## About Me

I like programming.
I write short hacks and small programs when I feel like it.
Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/tsung-ju)!

I also like theoretical computer science,
especially programming languages, logic, and type theory.
I study them in my [research](/research/).

I like visual arts, for their beauty and expressiveness.
I draw occasionally.

I like coffee that is not sour.

Currently I am finishing my MSc in Computer Science at the University of Toronto.
